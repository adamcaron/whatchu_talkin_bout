# Whatchu Talkin' Bout?

See what you're elected officials have been discussing on Twitter.

This is a project for [Turing School of Software & Design](turing.io). It's aim is to create a web application that authenticates with a third-party service, consumes and API, and solves an actual problem.

### Learning Goals

 - Learning how to build a full Rails app from idea to delivery
 - Revisiting previous concepts such as APIs and OAuth
 - Finding the strengths and gaps in your knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and organizing a project.

### Technical Expectations

Every project will be a bit different, but they need to share some common technical characteristics:

 - You must use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users
 - You must consume an external API
 - You must implement a production quality user interface
 - You must optimize your application optimizing your database, implementing caching, using background workers, and sending AJAX requests
